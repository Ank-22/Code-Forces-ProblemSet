## Important Points:
* If you have come looking for solution then this is your ally but remember **If you want to improve your skill then try to understand the code and implement it by yourself**.
* This repo for my own implementation and solution which you can use as a guide.
* If you are solving by your own and failing in few test case then think for **15 mins**, after that you can compare the solution for the given problem.
* I am trying my best to put up the solution as fast as I can so be patient.
* For now I will be putting the solution for *Python* then *CPP*
* For other languages please create a new issue with problem number and tags : ```Code``` & ``` " the language you want```.
* I you are proving the solution to the problem as a pull request then Thanks for your effort, I will review it and then pull it or it will be pull with filename as ``` solution_"your_username".extention```.
* These were some basic code of conduct which is needed to be followed. There will be a separate code of conduct file which will be push in future.
